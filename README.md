Using Java Swing to create and color a grid according to certain patterns

## Motivation
While browsing 538's articles, I found [a particular Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-heck-are-these-dang-bits/) intriguing. In it, an [image](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ellenberg.png) created by Jordan Ellenberg depicting a grid filled with red and blue squares was presented, and the reader was tasked with identifying the pattern used to form the grid. After eventually getting it, I figured the grid should be simple to recreate programmatically. The grid serves as a representation of some interesting mathematical concepts, as explained in [the solution to the Riddler post](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-space-no-one-can-hear-your-3d-printer-die/), but for the moment I just intend to display the grid using Java Swing.

## Usage
0. Download and install Java if necessary.
1. Compile the file with ```javac Grid.java```.
2. Run the file with ```java Grid```. A new window displaying an image of a grid of red and blue squares will open.

## Future
Allow the user to change the size of the grid and the number of colors.
